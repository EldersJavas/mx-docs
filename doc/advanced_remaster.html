<h3>How it Works</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In order to perform a live remaster, you just need to create the new linuxfs
file in the same directory as the existing linuxfs file with the ".new"
extension added.  On the next boot, before the linuxfs file is mounted, the
following commands are (in essence) performed in the directory containing
the linuxfs file:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code># mv linuxfs linuxfs.old
# mv linuxfs.new linuxfs</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If the new linuxfs file makes the system unbootable then the <span class="cheat">rollback</span>
boot code should be used.  It can either be added manually by the user or
there can be another Grub menu entry that contains the <span class="cheat">rollback</span> option.
In this case the following two commands are (in essence) performed in the
directory containing the linuxfs file:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code># mv linuxfs linuxfs.bad
# mv linuxfs.old linuxfs</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This reverses the previous actions except the file that was originally called
<code>linuxfs.new</code> is now called <code>linuxfs.bad</code>.  If you use the <span class="cheat">sqname</span> or
<span class="cheat">sqext</span> options to change the name of the linuxfs file then these names
are used instead of <code>linuxfs</code>.  For example if you boot with <span class="cheat">sqext=e16</span>
then we look for a file called <code>linuxfs.e16.new</code> etc.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>At its core, live remastering can be done with a single, simple command:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code># mklinuxfs /aufs linuxfs.new -e tmp var/tmp var/log</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Almost all of the work is in the details of using the right linuxfs file in
the right directory on the right device, making sure that device is mounted
and is writable, and finally, making sure there is enough free space on the
device to create the new linuxfs files.</p></div>

<h3 id="_the_devil_8217_s_in_the_details">The Devil&#8217;s in the Details</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>To make writing live remaster programs as easy as possible, the linuxrc
script generates a <code>remaster.conf</code> file in the <code>/live-config</code> directory
whenever remastering is possible.  This usually means that the boot device
is writable and we didn&#8217;t boot <span class="cheat">fromiso</span>.  In addition, this file
contains all the details you need to do a live remaster.  Here is an example:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example <code>/live-config/remaster.conf</code> file</div>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>BOOT_MP="/boot-dev"
BOOT_DEV="/dev/sdb2"
SQFILE_DIR="/boot-dev/MX-14-12"
SQFILE_FULL="/boot-dev/MX-14-12/linuxfs"
SQFILE_NAME="linuxfs"

AUFS_MP="/aufs"
AUFS_RAM_MP="/aufs-ram"

DID_REMASTER=""
DID_ROLLBACK=""</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Here is a bare-bones shell script to do remastering.  It is
not intended to be used (although it should work), it is meant
as a simple example to demonstrate the required steps, namely:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
read config file or exit if file does not exit
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
mount the boot device unless it is already mounted
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
remount it read-write if it is not already
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
create the new linuxfs file
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In practice, more error checking should be performed, more
verbose output should be available and devices that were
mounted should be unmounted, etc.  Programs should probably
ask if the user wants to reboot after the new linuxfs file
was created.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

conf_file=/live-config/remaster.conf

#--- Read variables from conf_file
[-f $conf_file ] || exit
source $conf_file

#--- Mount device holding linuxfs if needed
mountpoint -q $BOOT_MP || mount $BOOT_DEV $BOOT_MP

#--- remount read-write if needed
mnt_opts=$(grep "^$BOOT_DEV " /proc/mounts | cut -d" " -f4)
case ",$mnt_opts," in
    ,rw,) ;;
       *) mount -o remount,rw $BOOT_MP;;
esac

#--- create the new linuxfs file
mklinuxfs $AUFS_MP $SQFILE_FULL.new -e tmp var/tmp var/log</code></pre>
</div></div>

<div class="blue"><h2 id="_rolling_back_and_version_management">Rolling Back and Version Management</h2></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The linuxrc script offers crude emergency rollback option but that doesn&#8217;t
mean the remastering script can&#8217;t do rollbacks as well.  It&#8217;s best to think
of the remaster script as being in control and the linuxrc script offering
a service: to replace the <code>linuxfs</code> file with <code>linuxfs.new</code>.  If the linuxrc
script has just performed a remaster or a rollback, this will be reported in
the  <code>/live-config/remaster.conf</code> file.  But that is not 100% reliable since
it is possible that another reboot has occurred before the remaster script has
been run.  What is reliable (or at least much more reliable) is the existence
of the files: <code>linuxfs.old</code> or <code>linuxfs.bad</code>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Generally, a full-featured live-remaster program will use the existence of one
of these files as an indication of either a successful remaster or a rollback.
The script should then "do something" with these files so that it does not
keep thinking a remaster or rollback just occurred.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_symlinks_can_help">Symlinks can Help</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>If a user performs several remasters with or without rollbacks, it will be
very easy to lose track of which version is which.  An easy way around this
problem is to use symlinks for all the linuxfs files, possibly including
the first.  When creating a new LiveUSB, you can name the linuxfs file
<code>linuxfs.00</code> and create a <code>linuxfs</code> symlink that points to it:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>    linuxfs --&gt; linuxfs.00</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When it is time to do the first remaster, the new linuxfs file can be
called <code>linuxfs.01</code> with a symlink pointing to it called <code>linuxfs.new</code>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>   linuxfs.new --&gt; linuxfs.01</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can easily tell which version of linuxfs is being used by looking at
the extension of the file the <code>linuxfs</code> symlink points to.  For example:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>$  basename $(readlink -f $SQFILE_FULL) | sed 's/.*\.\([0-9]\+\)$/\1/'</code></pre>
</div></div>
</div>

<div class="blue"><h2 id="_estimating_the_size_of_a_new_linuxfs_file">Estimating the Size of a New Linuxfs File</h2></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Since making a new linuxfs file can consume time and resources it is
important to not start the process when we know there is not enough room on
the device to complete it. In other words, we need to estimate how much the
file system will get compressed.  If past performance is indicative of future
results then we can look at the compression ratios for the linuxfs files
distribution in the standard ISO files:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Looking over various versions, the ratios are all within 10% of 0.41.  I&#8217;d suggest using a safety margin
of 10 Meg + 10% but even this might not suffice if, for example, a lot of
compressed media files or large amounts of pseudo-random data are stored.
For those cases the compression ratio will be close to 1.0 and might even
exceed 1.0 due to overhead.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can get an accurate measure of home much space the uncompressed file system
takes up with the <code>du</code> command applied to the AUFS mount point:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code># du -sm /aufs | cut -f1
892</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This says the file system takes up 892 Meg.  The estimate for the linuxfs
file would be 892 * .45 + 10 = 407 Meg.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It should be much faster to just look at the size of what is used in the RAM
part of the AUFS and then add this to the size of the existing linuxfs file:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code># du -sm /aufs-ram | cut -f1
23
# du -sm /boot-dev/MX-14-12/linuxfs | cut -f1
354</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is faster and it is also provides a more conservative estimate.  For
example, if the user has deleted a bunch of packages then the size of the
new linuxfs file will be smaller than the size of the original but this
estimate will always say the new linuxfs file will be larger than the
original.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the example above the RAM part of the AUFS file system takes up 23 Meg and
the original linuxfs file takes 354 Meg.  The estimate for the size of the
new linuxfs file is 354 + 23 * .45 + 10 = 374.  This is smaller than the
previous estimate because of the safety margins.  If you remove those then the
two estimates agree with within 1%.</p></div>
