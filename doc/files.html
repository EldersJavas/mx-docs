<div class="blue"><h2>Introduction</h2></div>
<p>File management in MX-14 is carried out through Thunar, a fast and powerful tool.  Much of its basic use is self-evident, but here are good things to know:</p>
<ul><li>Hidden files are out of sight by default, but can be made visible via the menu" (View > Show Hidden Files) or by pressing Ctrl-H</li>
<li>The Side Pane can be hidden, and directory (folder) shortcuts can be placed there by RC > Send To</li><li>The context menu has been populated with common actions that vary by what is present or under focus.</li><li>Root action is available via the context menu to open a terminal, edit as root, or open an instance of Thunar with root privileges.</li><li>Thunar easily handles FTP transfers, see below.</a></li></ul>


<div class="blue"><h2>Tips and Tricks</h2></div>
<ul><li>When working in a directory that requires superuser privileges, you can RC > Open root Thunar here.</li>
<li>You can set up tabs with File > New Tab (or Ctrl-T), then move items from one location to another by dragging them to a tab and releasing it.</li>
<li>Actions listed in the context menu can be edited/deleted, and new ones added, by clicking Edit > Configure custom actions... </li>
<li>Various options and hidden commands are also visible, see Help below.</li>
<li>Compressed files can be managed by RC on the file.  The archiver working in the background is file-roller (Start menu > Accessories > Archive Manager). </li>
<li>To find files, RC in a blank space > Find files here.  A dialog box will pop up to give you options. Running in the background is catfish (Start menu > Accessories > Catfish).</li>
<li>To set up a soft link (AKA symlink), RC the target (file or folder you want the link to point to) > Create symlink. Then RC the new symlink, cut it and paste it to where you want it.</li>
<li>To enable image thumbnails, see <a href="http://www.mepiscommunity.org/videos/thumbnail-images-thunar">this helpful video</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="blue"><h2 id="ftp">FTP</h2></div>
<p>The File Sharing Protocol (FTP) is used to transfer files from one host to another host over a network.</p>
<ul><li>Open Thunar and click on the Browse Network icon in the left pane</li>
<li>In the address field, type <code>ftp://NameOrAddressoOfServer</code>, for example mepiscommunity.org</li><li>Up pops an authorization dialog box, fill in username and pwd and let it save password if you are comfortable with that</li><li>That's it.  Once you have navigated to the folder you are always going to use, you can RC the folder > Send to > Side Pane to create a very simple way to connect.</li></ul>
<p>For a discussion of how FTP works, see <a href="http://www.ncftp.com/libncftp/doc/ftp_overview.html">this page</a>.</p>

<div class="blue"><h2 id="shares">Connecting to Shares</h2></div>
<p>Thunar can connect to shared folders (AKA Samba Shares) on Windows, Mac, Linux computers and NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices if Samba is installed.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Select Browse Network in the left pane to show various networks, including Windows Network</li>
<li>Click the Network you want to see available Workgroups (often called WORKGROUP by default). Now drill down to find what you are looking for.</li>
<ul>
<li>Select a Workgroup for available Samba Servers
<li>Select a Server for available Samba Shares
<li>Select a Samba Share to see all the available folders</li> 
<li>A shortcut for the selected Share will be created in the Network sidebar section 
</ul></ul><p>For other actions with Samba, see <a href="samba.html" >this document</a>.</p>
